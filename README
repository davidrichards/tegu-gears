== TeguGears

There is a need (at least for me) to have code that is:

* Interchangeable
* Composable
* Concurrent
* Distributable
* Memoized
* Documented

This is a step in that direction.  I have come up with some fairly interesting approaches for these libraries, I trust they may save you some time and effort as well.
